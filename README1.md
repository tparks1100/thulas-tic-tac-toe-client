Play Tic Tac Toe!

## Pre-Planning for this project

### A wireframe of what my game project will look like.

### Game Board Representation

I plan to represent the tic tac toe game using a table. The table will have thre <tr> tags to seperate each row, since a tic tac toe game has 3 rows. In javascript I Will select these elements and additional selectors to represent this game. Also all of the creating new players, old players being able to sign in, and everyone being able to sign out will all be coded in JS.

### Project Approach

Like mentioned below I plan to approach this project one step at a time. I am big on lists and the requirements.md does a great job of laying out everything that I need and the functionality my application needs to have. I plan to cross everything off my requirements list one and a time. Also a good idea is to make schedule blocks and time lines of when I Want to get certain items on my list done, so that I have a daily goal to reach every day.

### User Stories

### Plan for keeping Code Modular

The main goal of this project is to create a working tic tac toe game where the user can create a new log in, they can sign in if they have already made a profile, and they can also change their password and sign in and out. The user should be able to start a new game. The user should not be able to edit the game in any way after a user is determined, all of these requirements and more I Will tackle one at a time, and that is how I will approach making my code modular. I will make sure that I know exactly what my requirements are for being successful in this project and I will code these requirements out one by one. This will help with testing as well, if I am coding things out independently then texting before moving on to the next step then I can make sure I catch errors early on!

### Creative Spins

I want the website to look legit in a way that there is a nice color scheme that is user friendly, as in the user is able to easily read everything on the application. I would like to maybe somehow shhow the path of the win. When a player wins a line is drawn through the 3 in a row that they received.

### Version Control Usage

I will commit my project frequently to be able to track how many edits I have made but also what edits I have made. This will help me understand why I did certain things, but also help me track my project in a way where I Will also know how far along I am and what I have completed and also what else I need to do to accomplish finishing the project and meeting all requirements.

### Additional Features

I would like the user to be able to choose the color they want their X or O to be by clicking on a button that corresponds to the color they would like & I also want to have a list that tracks the top 5 lead scorers between all of the users that play my game and lists them for all players to see. When someone new breaks a high score then that list updates.
