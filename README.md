## Planning Story

My plan is to represent the tic tac toe game using a table. In javascript I will select these elements and additional selectors to represent this game. Also all of the creating new players, old players being able to sign in, and everyone being able to sign out will all be coded in JS. There will be forms and a gameboard that a user will interact with.

I plan to approach this project one step at a time. I am big on lists and the requirements.md does a great job of laying out everything that I need and the functionality my application needs to have. I plan to cross everything off my requirements list one at a time. A good idea is to make schedule blocks and time lines of when I want to get certain items on my list done, so that I have a daily goal to reach every day.

The main goal of this project is to create a working tic tac toe game where the user can create a new log in, they can sign in if they have already made a profile, and they can also change their password and sign in and out. The user should be able to start a new game. The user should not be able to edit the game in any way after a user is determined, all of these requirements and more I will tackle one at a time, and that is how I will approach making my code modular. I will make sure that I know exactly what my requirements are for being successful in this project and I will code these requirements out one by one. This will help with testing as well, if I am coding things out independently then texting before moving on to the next step then I can make sure I catch errors early on!

I will commit my project frequently to be able to track how many edits I have made but also what edits I have made. This will help me understand why I did certain things, but also help me track my project in a way where I Will also know how far along I am and what I have completed and also what else I need to do to accomplish finishing the project and meeting all requirements.

- I still need to allow the signed in user to view how many games were played
- Make the board look better.
- I need my new game button to also start a new game and not just start a new game by logging the user out.
